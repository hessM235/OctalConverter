# OctalConverter
Converts an octal number to binary or hexadecimal

Class project for introductory CS course using procedural programming to create an octal number converter.

The code isn't DRY in some places and some code in the main method should probably be in the getChoiceInput method -- this code needs refactoring.  In addition, the methods don't have comments. Feel free to borrow, fork, or use this code for educational purposes.
